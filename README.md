# 2023-Advent-Of-Code
This is my first time doing Advent of Code! Very excited to test my skills and learn some new concepts.I probably won't get through all of it, but whatever I end up with I'll post here (unless I'm too embarassed).

I will be using C++ for this. This is what I use at professionally, and I'm trying to get better with it.

On top of C++ I'm using:
- gcc
- Makefile
- Ubuntu (well really Ubuntu in WSL2 :) )
