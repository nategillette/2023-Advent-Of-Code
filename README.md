# [2023-Advent-Of-Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023)
This is my first time doing Advent of Code! Very excited to test my skills and learn some new concepts.I probably won't get through all of it, but whatever I end up with I'll post here (unless I'm too embarassed).

I will be using C++ for this. This is what I use at professionally, and I'm trying to get better with it.

On top of C++ I'm using:
- gcc
- Makefile
- Ubuntu 22.04

My first try! Was nervous going in, but this problem was fairly easy. Had a lot of fun and hope to make a good streak. 

I don't have any notes on what I did, this was a simple string parsing problem. Not the cleanest or most efficient way to do it, but it works!
